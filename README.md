## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned
At the beginning I thought this challenge would be easy, but as soon as I started it I realised that it was not like I thought,it was very challenging for me and that's why I liked it. In this challenge I've developed my skills in CSS grid and flexbox, I've also sharpened my JavaScript skills in adding interactivness to the site. It was a great project to work on and definitely added a lot of skills to my skill set. The most important thing is that I enjoyed it.
